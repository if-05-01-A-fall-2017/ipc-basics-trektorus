What is a race condition?
The race between 2 running process which are running in parallel, could cause troubles with the program. 

Disabling Interrupts
i.) Because context switches!
ii.) It could be an infinite long interrupt, because the process could take over!

i.)
Peterson’s Solution
Process 0: 	
	wants to go into the critical region
	Saves the other process in a variable, sets itself as interested, sets the other as the “loser” but continues because the other one isn’t interested yet

Meanwhile…
Process 1: 	
	wants to go into the critical region
	Saves the other process in a variable, overrides “loser” and stops cause the other one is interested

Process 0: 
	does his stuff
	Leaves critical region and sets itself as not interested anymore

Process 1: 	
	sees that the other one isn’t interested anymore and can continue to the end now until it leaves the critical region

ii.)
strict alternation
Process 0:

iii.)
the last one becomes the loser because he has to wait for the other process





iv.)
int loser;
int j = 0; //count variable for interested ones

void enter_region(int process) 
{ 
	j++;
	loser = process; 
	while (loser == process && j >= 1) ;
}
